        C# Assignment Requirements
    </h1>
    <p>
        You are to write a C#  parser program which will have numbered options and a recurring menu (this means the menu will continuously run until we give the command, it saves us time from having to relaunch the program every time a task is done). Option 1 will allow the user to enter a filename, this will indicate which file we wish to parse. Option 2 will parse the data in the file specified by option 1, if no valid file is indicated, then the program should return an error message and then return the user to the menu. Option 3 will end the program.

        Option 1 will prompt the user to enter a filename. The filename will be stored in a local variable.
        
        Option 2 will prompt the user to enter a string. It will then go through the file specified by option 1 and replace any sequences of the user entered string with a blank space.
        
        A while-loop menu: the menu will continue to display until option 3 is entered as input, at that point the program will terminate.
